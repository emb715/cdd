## ⚡ Common Workflows

### Starting Fresh
```bash
/create-work user notification system
# Answer questions
# Review DECISIONS.md
/plan-work 0001
# Start coding
```

### Daily Work
```bash
# Morning
/list-work --status=in-progress
# Pick work item, code

# End of day
/save-session 0001
```

### Finishing Work
```bash
# Check all requirements met
/complete-work 0001
# Review IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
# Create follow-up work if needed
```

## 📋 Work Item Types

| Type | Emoji | Folder | Use For |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| Feature | 🎨 | `cdd/XXXX-*` | New features, enhancements |
| Bug | 🐛 | `cdd/bugs/XXXX-*` | Bug fixes, issues |
| Refactor | 🔧 | `cdd/refactor/XXXX-*` | Code improvements, tech debt |
| Spike | 🔬 | `cdd/spikes/XXXX-*` | Research, POCs, exploration |
| Epic | 🎯 | `cdd/epics/XXXX-*` | Large multi-feature initiatives |

## 📄 Document Purposes

| File | What It Is | Update Frequency |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **DECISIONS.md** | Requirements, decisions, context | Create once, update if requirements change |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** | Task breakdown, roadmap | Generated by `/plan-work`, rarely manual edits |
| **SESSION_NOTES.md** | Running log of all sessions | After every session via `/save-session` |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** | Final retrospective | Generated once by `/complete-work` |

## 🎯 Status Values

- `draft` - Created but not started
- `in-progress` - Actively working
- `blocked` - Stuck on dependency or issue
- `complete` - Finished and deployed

## 🏷️ Priority Values

- `critical` - System down, urgent fix needed
- `high` - Important, should do soon
- `medium` - Normal priority
- `low` - Nice to have, low urgency

## 💡 Command Tips

### `/create-work`
```bash
# Be specific
/create-work user authentication with OAuth and email

# Not vague
/create-work auth stuff
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Answer questions thoughtfully - better input = better docs
- Review generated DECISIONS.md before planning
- List any context files you know about

### `/plan-work`
```bash
# By work ID
/plan-work 0001

# By fuzzy name
/plan-work user auth

# By full path
/plan-work cdd/0001-user-authentication
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Wait for "Go" confirmation before sub-tasks generate
- Review parent tasks first, adjust if needed
- Check that context files are correct

### `/save-session`
```bash
# Explicit work ID
/save-session 0001

# Auto-detect from conversation
/save-session
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Save sessions regularly (end of each work session)
- Document decisions with rationale
- Flag blockers as they occur
- Don't wait until work is complete

### `/complete-work`
```bash
/complete-work 0001
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Verify all FR-X requirements met first
- Review SESSION_NOTES.md tells complete story
- Create follow-up work items for deferred features
- Celebrate completion! 🎉

### `/list-work`
```bash
# All work items
/list-work

# Filter by status
/list-work --status=in-progress

# Filter by type
/list-work --type=bug

# Filter by priority
/list-work --priority=critical

# Combine filters
/list-work --status=draft --priority=high

# Dashboard view
/list-work --dashboard
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Use `/list-work` each morning to see what's active
- Filter by `--status=draft` to find work needing planning
- Use `--priority=critical` to find urgent items

## 🔍 Finding Work Items

```bash
# List all features
ls cdd/

# List all bugs
ls cdd/bugs/

# Search by keyword
grep -r "authentication" cdd/

# Find by tag
grep -r "tags:.*auth" cdd/*/DECISIONS.md
```

## 📊 Work Item Lifecycle

```
1. CREATE
   /create-work [description]
   → Answer questions
   → Review DECISIONS.md
   → Status: draft

2. PLAN
   /plan-work [id]
   → Generate tasks
   → Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   → Status: draft (or → in-progress)

3. IMPLEMENT
   [Code implementation]
   → Follow IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   → /save-session after each session
   → Status: in-progress (or blocked)

4. COMPLETE
   /complete-work [id]
   → Validate requirements met
   → Generate IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
   → Status: complete
```

## ✅ Best Practices Checklist

### Creating Work

- [ ] Update blockers immediately
- [ ] Reference patterns from codebase

### Completing Work
- [ ] All functional requirements met
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] SESSION_NOTES.md complete
- [ ] Follow-up work items created

## 🛠️ Customization

### Templates
Edit in `cdd/.meta/templates/`:
- `DECISIONS_TEMPLATE.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`
- `SESSION_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md`

### Commands
Edit in `.claude/commands/`:

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Forgetting to save sessions | Set reminder: save sessions daily |
| Vague work descriptions | Be specific: "User auth with OAuth" not "auth" |
| Not reviewing generated docs | Always review DECISIONS.md before `/plan-work` |
| Skipping planning | Always `/plan-work` before coding |
| Marking incomplete work done | Verify all FR-X before `/complete-work` |
| Not listing context files | Tell AI which files are important |

## ❓ Quick FAQ

**Q: Minimum time investment?**
A: 15min create + 5min plan + 2min/session notes = ~25min overhead. Saves 30min+/session.

**Q: Can I skip IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md?**
A: Not recommended. Tasks keep you focused and prevent scope creep.

**Q: How detailed should SESSION_NOTES.md be?**
A: Enough to understand what was done and why. 5-10 minutes of notes = hours saved later.

**Q: What if I worked on multiple items in one session?**
A: Save session for each item separately, or save primary item and mention others.

**Q: Can I modify templates?**
A: Yes! Edit templates in `cdd/.meta/templates/` to fit your needs.
